cfm2php

This converter will get you about 60% there on simple ColdFusion
sites.  It was created to help with translating a web app that was
pretty much entirely simple database query results interpolated into
HTML, so that's the only thing that it's likely to be useful for.

It's a perl script, so no install (unless you live in a cave and don't
have perl), just chmod u+x cfm2php.perl and you're good to go.

SYNOPSIS
        cfm2php [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
        cfm2php does a search and replace on all named input FILEs
        with a .cfm extension, and output's the changed context in
        file of the same base name with a .php extension.

OPTIONS

         --out-prefix=PREFIX
               Prepend the output filename's with PREFIX.  Literal text
               concatenation, so relative or absolute path's, as well as
               simple name prefixes should all work.
